# landing-page-project
The Odin Project's 'Landing Page' Project.

This project involves me building a Landing Page from scratch, copying a design given to me by The Odin Project.
I will need to use both HTML and CSS to create a succesful landing page. I will also need to use Git commands to push my work to Github.
